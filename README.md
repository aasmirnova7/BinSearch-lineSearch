# BinSearch-lineSearch
Implement in C ++ the direct and binary search for a given element in an array of objects by the key (the key is the first field of the object). Perform a search 7-10 times on arrays of different dimensions from 500 and more. Searches (programmatically) the search time for the following methods: direct search, binary search in a pre-sorted array, sorting the array (the most efficient method from work 2), and binary search in it.
